<h2><a name="The_Worlds_Need" id="The_Worlds_Need"></a><b>The World's Need</b></h2>

<p>So many gods, so many creeds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So many paths that wind and wind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While just the art of being kind,</span><br />
Is all the sad world needs.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="High_Noon" id="High_Noon"></a><b>High Noon</b></h2>


<p>Time's finger on the dial of my life<br />
Points to high noon! and yet the half-spent day<br />
Leaves less than half remaining, for the dark,<br />
Bleak shadows of the grave engulf the end.</p>

<p>To those who burn the candle to the stick,<br />
The sputtering socket yields but little light.<br />
Long life is sadder than an early death.<br />
We cannot count on raveled threads of age<br />
Whereof to weave a fabric. We must use<br />
The warp and woof the ready present yields<br />
And toil while daylight lasts. When I bethink<br />
How brief the past, the future still more brief,<br />
Calls on to action, action! Not for me<br />
Is time for retrospection or for dreams,<br />
Not time for self-laudation or remorse.<br />
Have I done nobly? Then I must not let<br />
Dead yesterday unborn to-morrow shame.<br />
Have I done wrong? Well, let the bitter taste<br />
Of fruit that turned to ashes on my lip<br />
Be my reminder in temptation's hour,<br />
And keep me silent when I would condemn.<br />
Sometimes it takes the acid of a sin<br />
To cleanse the clouded windows of our souls<br />
So pity may shine through them.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 6em;">Looking back,</span><br />
My faults and errors seem like stepping-stones<br />
That led the way to knowledge of the truth<br />
And made me value virtue; sorrows shine<br />
In rainbow colors o'er the gulf of years,<br />
Where lie forgotten pleasures.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 6em;">Looking forth,</span><br />
Out to the western sky still bright with noon,<br />
I feel well spurred and booted for the strife<br />
That ends not till Nirvana is attained.</p>

<p>Battling with fate, with men and with myself,<br />
Up the steep summit of my life's forenoon,<br />
Three things I learned, three things of precious worth<br />
To guide and help me down the western slope.<br />
I have learned how to pray, and toil, and save.<br />
To pray for courage to receive what comes,<br />
Knowing what comes to be divinely sent.<br />
To toil for universal good, since thus<br />
And only thus can good come unto me.<br />
To save, by giving whatsoe'er I have<br />
To those who have not, this alone is gain.</p>

<h2><a name="Transformation" id="Transformation"></a><b>Transformation</b></h2>


<p>She waited in a rose-hued room;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A wanton-hearted creature she,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But beautiful and bright to see</span><br />
As some great orchid just in bloom.</p>

<p>Upon wide cushions stretched at ease<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She lolled in garments filmy fine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which but enhanced each rounded line;</span><br />
A living picture, framed to please.</p>

<p>A bold electric eye of light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leered through its ruddy screen of lace</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And feasted on her form and face</span><br />
As some wine-crimsoned rou&eacute; might.</p>

<p>From wall and niche, nude nymph beguiled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fair goddesses of world-wide fame,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Psyche's self was put to shame</span><br />
By one who from the cushions smiled.</p>

<p>Exotic blossoms from a vase<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their sweet narcotic breath exhaled;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lights, the objects round her paled&mdash;</span><br />
She lost the sense of time and place.</p>

<p>She seemed to float upon the air,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Untrammeled, unrestricted, free;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rising from a vapory sea</span><br />
She saw a form divinely fair.</p>

<p>A beauteous being in whose face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shone all things sweet and true and good.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The innocence of maidenhood,</span><br />
The motherhood of all the race.</p>

<p>The warmth which comes from heavenly fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The strength which leads the weaker man</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To climb to God's Eternal plan</span><br />
And conquer and control desire.</p>

<p>She shook as with a mighty awe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For, gazing on this shape which stood</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Embodying all true womanhood,</span><br />
She knew it was <i>herself</i> she saw.</p>

<p>She woke as from a dream. But when<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The laughing lover, light and bold</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came with his talk of wine and gold</span><br />
He gazed, grew silent, gazed again;</p>

<p>Then turned abashed from those calm eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where lurked no more the lure to sin.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her higher self had entered in,</span><br />
Her path led now to Paradise.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Thought-Magnets" id="Thought-Magnets"></a><b>Thought-Magnets</b></h2>


<p>With each strong thought, with every earnest longing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For aught thou deemest needful to thy soul,</span><br />
Invisible vast forces are set thronging<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Between thee and that goal.</span></p>

<p>'Tis only when some hidden weakness alters<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And changes thy desire, or makes it less,</span><br />
That this mysterious army ever falters<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or stops short of success.</span></p>

<p>Thought is a magnet; and the longed-for pleasure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or boon, or aim, or object, is the steel;</span><br />
And its attainment hangs but on the measure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of what thy soul can feel.</span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Smiles" id="Smiles"></a><b>Smiles</b></h2>


<p>Smile a little, smile a little,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As you go along,</span><br />
Not alone when life is pleasant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when things go wrong.</span><br />
Care delights to see you frowning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Loves to hear you sigh;</span><br />
Turn a smiling face upon her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quick the dame will fly.</span></p>

<p>Smile a little, smile a little,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All along the road;</span><br />
Every life must have its burden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Every heart its load.</span><br />
Why sit down in gloom and darkness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With your grief to sup?</span><br />
As you drink Fate's bitter tonic,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smile across the cup.</span></p>


<p>Smile upon the troubled pilgrims<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whom you pass and meet;</span><br />
Frowns are thorns, and smiles are blossoms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oft for weary feet.</span><br />
Do not make the way seem harder<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By a sullen face,</span><br />
Smile a little, smile a little,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brighten up the place.</span></p>

<p>Smile upon your undone labor;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not for one who grieves</span><br />
O'er his task, waits wealth or glory;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He who smiles achieves.</span><br />
Though you meet with loss and sorrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the passing years,</span><br />
Smile a little, smile a little,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Even through your tears.</span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="The_Undiscovered_Country" id="The_Undiscovered_Country"></a><b>The Undiscovered Country</b></h2>


<p>Man has explored all countries and all lands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made his own the secrets of each clime.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now, ere the world has fully reached its prime,</span><br />
The oval earth lies compassed with steel bands;<br />
The seas are slaves to ships that touch all strands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And even the haughty elements sublime</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bold, yield him their secrets for all time,</span><br />
And speed like lackeys forth at his commands.</p>

<p>Still, though he search from shore to distant shore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And no strange realms, no unlocated plains</span><br />
Are left for his attainment and control,<br />
Yet is there one more kingdom to explore.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Go, know thyself, O man! there yet remains</span><br />
The undiscovered country of thy soul!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="The_Universal_Route" id="The_Universal_Route"></a><b>The Universal Route</b></h2>


<p>As we journey along, with a laugh and a song,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We see, on youth's flower-decked slope,</span><br />
Like a beacon of light, shining fair on the sight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The beautiful Station of Hope.</span></p>

<p>But the wheels of old Time roll along as we climb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our youth speeds away on the years;</span><br />
And with hearts that are numb with life's sorrows we come<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the mist-covered Station of Tears.</span></p>

<p>Still onward we pass, where the milestones, alas!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are the tombs of our dead, to the West,</span><br />
Where glitters and gleams, in the dying sunbeams,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sweet, silent Station of Rest.</span></p>

<p>All rest is but change, and no grave can estrange<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The soul from its Parent above;</span><br />
And, scorning the rod, it soars back to its God,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the limitless City of Love.</span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Earthly_Pride" id="Earthly_Pride"></a><b>Earthly Pride</b></h2>


<p>How baseless is the mightiest earthly pride,<br />
The diamond is but charcoal purified,<br />
The lordliest pearl that decks a monarch's breast<br />
Is but an insect's sepulchre at best.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Unanswered_Prayers" id="Unanswered_Prayers"></a><b>Unanswered Prayers</b></h2>


<p>Like some school master, kind in being stern,<br />
Who hears the children crying o'er their slates<br />
And calling, "Help me master!" yet helps not,<br />
Since in his silence and refusal lies<br />
Their self-development, so God abides<br />
Unheeding many prayers. He is not deaf<br />
To any cry sent up from earnest hearts,<br />
He hears and strengthens when He must deny.<br />
He sees us weeping over life's hard sums<br />
But should He give the key and dry our tears<br />
What would it profit us when school were done<br />
And not one lesson mastered?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 14em;">What a world</span><br />
Were this if all our prayers were answered. Not<br />
In famed Pandora's box were such vast ills<br />
As lie in human hearts. Should our desires<br />
Voiced one by one in prayer ascend to God<br />
And come back as events shaped to our wish<br />
What chaos would result!</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 12em;">In my fierce youth</span><br />
I sighed out breath enough to move a fleet<br />
Voicing wild prayers to heaven for fancied boons<br />
Which were denied; and that denial bends<br />
My knee to prayers of gratitude each day<br />
Of my maturer years. Yet from those prayers<br />
I rose alway regirded for the strife<br />
And conscious of new strength. Pray on, sad heart,<br />
That which thou pleadest for may not be given<br />
But in the lofty altitude where souls<br />
Who supplicate God's grace are lifted there<br />
Thou shalt find help to bear thy daily lot<br />
Which is not elsewhere found.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Thanksgiving" id="Thanksgiving"></a><b>Thanksgiving</b></h2>


<p>We walk on starry fields of white<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And do not see the daisies;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For blessings common in our sight</span><br />
We rarely offer praises.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We sigh for some supreme delight<br />
To crown our lives with splendor,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And quite ignore our daily store<br />
Of pleasures sweet and tender.</span></p>

<p>Our cares are bold and push their way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon our thought and feeling.</span><br />
They hang about us all the day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our time from pleasure stealing.</span><br />
So unobtrusive many a joy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We pass by and forget it,</span><br />
But worry strives to own our lives<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And conquers if we let it.</span></p>

<p>There's not a day in all the year<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But holds some hidden pleasure,</span><br />
And looking back, joys oft appear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To brim the past's wide measure.</span><br />
But blessings are like friends, I hold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who love and labor near us.</span><br />
We ought to raise our notes of praise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While living hearts can hear us.</span></p>

<p>Full many a blessing wears the guise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of worry or of trouble.</span><br />
Farseeing is the soul and wise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who knows the mask is double.</span><br />
But he who has the faith and strength<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To thank his God for sorrow</span><br />
Has found a joy without alloy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To gladden every morrow.</span></p>

<p>We ought to make the moments notes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of happy, glad Thanksgiving;</span><br />
The hours and days a silent phrase<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of music we are living.</span><br />
And so the theme should swell and grow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As weeks and months pass o'er us,</span><br />
And rise sublime at this good time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A grand Thanksgiving chorus.</span></p>

<h2><a name="A_Maiden_To_Her_Mirror" id="A_Maiden_To_Her_Mirror"></a><b>A Maiden To Her Mirror</b></h2>


<p>He said he loved me! Then he called my hair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Silk threads wherewith sly Cupid strings his bow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My cheek a rose leaf fallen on new snow;</span><br />
And swore my round, full throat would bring despair<br />
To Venus or to Psyche.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 12em;">Time and care</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will fade these locks; the merry god, I trow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Uses no grizzled cords upon his bow.</span><br />
How will it be when I, no longer fair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Plead for his kiss with cheeks whence long ago</span><br />
The early snowflakes melted quite away,<br />
The rose leaf died&mdash;and in whose sallow clay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lie the deep sunken tracks of life's gaunt crow?</span></p>

<p>When this full throat shall wattle fold on fold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like some ripe peach left drying on a wall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or like a spent accordion, when all</span><br />
Its music has exhaled&mdash;will love grow cold?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="The_Kettle" id="The_Kettle"></a><b>The Kettle</b></h2>


<p>There's many a house of grandeur,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With turret, tower and dome,</span><br />
That knows not peace or comfort,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And does not prove a home.</span><br />
<i>I</i> do not ask for splendor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To crown my daily lot,</span><br />
But this I ask&mdash;a kitchen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the kettle's always hot.</span></p>

<p>If things are not all ship-shape,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I do not fume or fret,</span><br />
A little clean disorder<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Does not my nerves upset.</span><br />
But <i>one</i> thing is essential,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or seems so to my thought,</span><br />
And that's a tidy kitchen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the kettle's always hot.</span></p>

<p>In my Aunt Hattie's household,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though skies outside are drear,</span><br />
Though times are dark and troubled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You'll always find good cheer.</span><br />
And in her quaint old kitchen&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The very homiest spot&mdash;</span><br />
The kettle's always singing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The water's always hot.</span></p>

<p>And if you have a headache,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whate'er the hour may be,</span><br />
There is no tedious waiting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To get your cup of tea.</span><br />
I don't know how she does it&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some magic she has caught&mdash;</span><br />
For the kitchen's cool in summer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet the kettle's always hot.</span></p>

<p>Oh, there's naught else so dreary<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In household kingdom found</span><br />
As a cold and sullen kettle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That does not make a sound.</span><br />
And I think that love is lacking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the hearts in such a spot,</span><br />
Or the kettle would be singing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the water would be hot.</span></p>

<h2><a name="Thy_Ship" id="Thy_Ship"></a><b>Thy Ship</b></h2>


<p>Hadst thou a ship, in whose vast hold lay stored<br />
The priceless riches of all climes and lands,<br />
Say, wouldst thou let it float upon the seas<br />
Unpiloted, of fickle winds the sport,<br />
And of wild waves and hidden rocks the prey?</p>

<p>Thine is that ship; and in its depths concealed<br />
Lies all the wealth of this vast universe&mdash;<br />
Yea, lies some part of God's omnipotence<br />
The legacy divine of every soul.<br />
Thy will, O man, thy will is that great ship,<br />
And yet behold it drifting here and there&mdash;<br />
One moment lying motionless in port,<br />
Then on high seas by sudden impulse flung,</p>

<p>Then drying on the sands, and yet again<br />
Sent forth on idle quests to no-man's land<br />
To carry nothing and to nothing bring;<br />
Till worn and fretted by the aimless strife<br />
And buffeted by vacillating winds<br />
It founders on a rock, or springs aleak<br />
With all its unused treasures in the hold.</p>

<p>Go save thy ship, thou sluggard; take the wheel<br />
And steer to knowledge, glory and success.<br />
Great mariners have made the pathway plain<br />
For thee to follow; hold thou to the course<br />
Of Concentration Channel, and all things<br />
Shall come in answer to thy swerveless wish<br />
As comes the needle to the magnet's call,<br />
Or sunlight to the prisoned blade of grass<br />
That yearns all winter for the kiss of spring.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Tryst" id="The_Tryst"></a><b>The Tryst</b></h2>


<p>Just when all hope had perished in my soul,<br />
And balked desire made havoc with my mind,<br />
My cruel Ladye suddenly grew kind,<br />
And sent these gracious words upon a scroll:<br />
"When knowing Night her dusky scarf has tied<br />
Across the bold, intrusive eyes of day,<br />
Come as a glad, triumphant lover may,<br />
No longer fearing that he be denied."</p>

<p>I read her letter for the hundredth time,<br />
And for the hundredth time my gladdened sight<br />
Blurred with the rapture of my vast delight,<br />
And swooned upon the page. I caught the chime<br />
Of far off bells, and at each silver note<br />
My heart on tiptoe pressed its eager ear<br />
Against my breast; it was such joy to hear<br />
The tolling of the hour of which she wrote.</p>

<p>The curious day still lingered in the skies<br />
And watched me as I hastened to the tryst.<br />
And back, beyond great clouds of amethyst,<br />
I saw the Night's soft, reassuring eyes.<br />
"Oh, Night," I cried, "dear Love's considerate friend,<br />
Haste from the far, dim valleys of the west,<br />
Rock the sad striving earth to quiet rest,<br />
And bid the day's insistent vigil end."</p>

<p>Down brooding streets, and past the harbored ships<br />
The Night's young handmaid, Twilight, walked with me.<br />
A spent moon leaned inertly o'er the sea;<br />
A few, pale, phantom stars were in eclipse.<br />
There was the house, My Ladye's sea-girt bower<br />
All draped in gloom, save for one taper's glow,<br />
Which lit the path, where willing feet would go.<br />
There was the house, and this the promised hour.</p>

<p>The tide was out; and from the sea's salt path<br />
Rose amorous odors, filtering through the night<br />
And stirring all the senses with delight;<br />
Sweet perfumes left since Aphrodite's bath.<br />
Back in the wooded copse, a whip-poor-will<br />
Gave love's impassioned and impatient call.<br />
On pebbled sands I heard the waves kiss fall,<br />
And fall again, so hushed the hour and still.</p>

<p>Light was my knock upon the door, so light,<br />
And yet the sound seemed rude. My pulses beat<br />
So loud they drowned the coming of her feet<br />
The arrow of her taper pierced the gloom&mdash;<br />
The portal closed behind me. She was there&mdash;<br />
Love on her lips and yielding in her eyes<br />
And but the sea to hear our vows and sighs.<br />
She took my hand and led me up the stair.</p>

<p>All in the dark we grope along,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And if we go amiss</span><br />
We learn at least which path is wrong,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there is gain in this.</span></p>

<p>We do not always win the race,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By only running right,</span><br />
We have to tread the mountain's base<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before we reach its height.</span></p>

<p>The Christs alone no errors made;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So often had they trod</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They had become as God.</span></p>

<p>As Krishna, Buddha, Christ again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They passed along the way,</span><br />
And left those mighty truths which men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But dimly grasp to-day.</span></p>

<p>But he who loves himself the last<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And knows the use of pain,</span><br />
Though strewn with errors all his past,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He surely shall attain.</span></p>

<p>Some souls there are that needs must taste<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of wrong, ere choosing right;</span><br />

<p>Oh many a duel the world has seen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That was bitter with hate, that was red with gore,</span><br />
But I sing of a duel by far more cruel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than ever by poet was sung before.</span><br />
It was waged by night, yea by day and by night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With never a pause or halt or rest,</span><br />
And the curious spot where this battle was fought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was the throbbing heart in a woman's breast.</span></p>

<p>There met two rivals in deadly strife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they fought for this woman so pale and proud.</span><br />
One was a man in the prime of life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And one was a corpse in a moldy shroud;</span><br />
One wrapped in a sheet from his head to his feet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The other one clothed in worldly fashion;</span><br />
But a rival to dread is a man who is dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If he has been loved in life with passion.</span></p>

<p>The living lover he battled with sighs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He strove for the woman with words that burned,</span><br />
While stiff and stark lay the corpse in the dark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And silently yearned and yearned and yearned.</span><br />
One spoke of the rapture that life still held<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For hearts that yielded to love's desire,</span><br />
And one through the cold grave's earthy mold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sent thoughts of a past that were fraught with fire.</span></p>

<p>The living lover seized hold of her hands&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You are mine," he cried, "and we will not part!"</span><br />
But she felt the clutch of the dead man's touch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the tense-drawn strings of her aching heart.</span><br />
Yet the touch was of ice, and she shrank with fear&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! the hands of the dead are cold, so cold&mdash;</span><br />
And warm were the arms that waited near<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To gather her close in their clinging fold.</span></p>

<p>And warm was the light in the living eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the eyes of the dead, how they stare and stare!</span><br />
With sudden surrender she turned to the tender<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And passionate lover who wooed her there.</span><br />
Farewell to sorrow, hail, sweet to-morrow!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The battle was over, the duel was done.</span><br />
They swooned in the blisses of love's fond kisses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the dead man stared on in the dark alone.</span></p>

<p>When Christmas bells are swinging above the fields of snow,<br />
We hear sweet voices ringing from lands of long ago.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And etched on vacant places,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Are half forgotten faces</span><br />
Of friends we used to cherish, and loves we used to know&mdash;<br />
When Christmas bells are swinging above the fields of snow.</p>

<p>Uprising from the ocean of the present surging near,<br />
We see, with strange emotion that is not free from fear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">That continent Elysian</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Long vanished from our vision,</span><br />
Youth's lovely lost Atlantis, so mourned for and so dear,<br />
Uprising from the ocean of the present surging near.</p>

<p>When gloomy gray Decembers are roused to Christmas mirth,<br />
The dullest life remembers there once was joy on earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And draws from youth's recesses</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Some memory it possesses,</span><br />
And, gazing through the lens of time, exaggerates its worth,<br />
When gloomy gray December is roused to Christmas mirth.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Not all the seers and sages</span><br />

<p>For life was made for loving, and love alone repays,<br />
As passing years are proving for all of Time's sad ways.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">There lies a sting in pleasure,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And fame gives shallow measure,</span><br />
And wealth is but a phantom that mocks the restless days,<br />
For life was made for loving, and only loving pays.</p>

<p>When Christmas bells are pelting the air with silver chimes,<br />
And silences are melting to soft, melodious rhymes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Let Love, the world's beginning,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">End fear and hate and sinning;</span><br />
Let Love, the God Eternal, be worshiped in all climes<br />
When Christmas bells are pelting the air with silver chimes.</p>

<p>I am a river flowing from God's sea<br />
Through devious ways. He mapped my course for me;<br />
I cannot change it; mine alone the toil<br />
To keep the waters free from grime and soil.<br />
The winding river ends where it began;<br />
And when my life has compassed its brief span<br />
I must return to that mysterious source.<br />
So let me gather daily on my course<br />
The perfume from the blossoms as I pass,<br />
Balm from the pines, and healing from the grass,<br />
And carry down my current as I go<br />
Not common stones but precious gems to show;<br />
And tears (the holy water from sad eyes)<br />
Back to God's sea, from which all rivers rise<br />
Let me convey, not blood from wounded hearts,<br />
Nor poison which the upas tree imparts.<br />
When over flowery vales I leap with joy,<br />
Let me not devastate them, nor destroy,<br />
But rather leave them fairer to the sight;<br />
Mine be the lot to comfort and delight.<br />
And if down awful chasms I needs must leap<br />
Let me not murmur at my lot, but sweep<br />
On bravely to the end without one fear,<br />
Knowing that He who planned my ways stands near.<br />
Love sent me forth, to Love I go again,<br />
For Love is all, and over all. Amen.</p>

<h2><a name="Sorry" id="Sorry"></a><b>Sorry</b></h2>


<p>There is much that makes me sorry as I journey down life's way.<br />
And I seem to see more pathos in poor human lives each day.<br />
I'm sorry for the strong brave men, who shield the weak from harm,<br />
But who, in their own troubled hours find no protecting arm.</p>

<p>I am sorry for the victors who have reached success, to stand<br />
As targets for the arrows shot by envious failure's hand.<br />
I'm sorry for the generous hearts who freely shared their wine,<br />
But drink alone the gall of tears in fortune's drear decline.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for the souls who build their own fame's funeral pyre,<br />
Derided by the scornful throng like ice deriding fire.<br />
I'm sorry for the conquering ones who know not sin's defeat,<br />
But daily tread down fierce desire 'neath scorched and bleeding feet.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for the anguished hearts that break with passion's strain,<br />
But I'm sorrier for the poor starved souls that never knew love's pain.<br />
Who hunger on through barren years not tasting joys they crave,<br />
For sadder far is such a lot than weeping o'er a grave.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for the souls that come unwelcomed into birth,<br />
I'm sorry for the unloved old who cumber up the earth.<br />
I'm sorry for the suffering poor in life's great maelstrom hurled,<br />
In truth I'm sorry for them all who make this aching world.</p>

<p>But underneath whate'er seems sad and is not understood,<br />
I know there lies hid from our sight a mighty germ of good.<br />
And this belief stands firm by me, my sermon, motto, text&mdash;<br />
The sorriest things in this life will seem grandest in the next.</p>

We live a simple and natural life.</p>

<p>"Here, in the midst of the clash and din,<br />
We know what it is to be calm within.</p>

<p>"Here, environed by sin and shame,<br />
We do what we can with our pure white flame.</p>

<p>"We do what we can with our bloom and grace,<br />
To make the city a fairer place.</p>

<p>"It is well to be good though the world is vile,<br />
And so through the dust and the smoke we smile,</p>

<p>"We are but atoms in chaos tossed,<br />
Yet never a purpose for truth was lost."</p>

<p>Ah, many a sermon is uttered there<br />
By the bed of blossoms in Greeley square.</p>

<p>And he who listens and hears aright,<br />
Is better equipped for the world's hard fight.</p>

In that poor word "environment,"<br />

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">It masters time, it conquers space,</span><br />

<h2><a name="To_An_Astrologer" id="To_An_Astrologer"></a><b>To An Astrologer</b></h2>


<p>Nay, seer, I do not doubt thy mystic lore,<br />
Nor question that the tenor of my life,<br />
Past, present and the future, is revealed<br />
There in my horoscope. I do believe<br />
That yon dead moon compels the haughty seas<br />
To ebb and flow, and that my natal star<br />
Stands like a stern-browed sentinel in space<br />
And challenges events; nor lets one grief,<br />
Or joy, or failure, or success, pass on<br />
To mar or bless my earthly lot, until<br />
It proves its Karmic right to come to me.</p>

<p>All this I grant, but more than this I <i>know</i>!<br />
Before the solar systems were conceived,<br />
When nothing was but the unnamable,<br />
My spirit lived, an atom of the Cause.<br />
Through countless ages and in many forms<br />
It has existed, ere it entered in<br />
This human frame to serve its little day<br />
Upon the earth. The deathless Me of me,<br />
The spark from that great all-creative fire<br />
Is part of that eternal source called God,<br />
And mightier than the universe.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 12em;">Why, he</span><br />
Who knows, and knowing, never once forgets<br />
The pedigree divine of his own soul,<br />
Can conquer, shape and govern destiny<br />
And use vast space as 'twere a board for chess<br />
With stars for pawns; can change his horoscope<br />
To suit his will; turn failure to success,<br />
And from preordained sorrows, harvest joy.</p>

<p>There is no puny planet, sun or moon,<br />
Or zodiacal sign which can control<br />
The God in us! If we bring <i>that</i> to bear<br />
Upon events, we mold them to our wish,<br />
'Tis when the infinite 'neath the finite gropes<br />
That men are governed by their horoscopes.</p>

<p>Under the snow in the dark and the cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A pale little sprout was humming;</span><br />
Sweetly it sang, 'neath the frozen mold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the beautiful days that were coming.</span></p>

<p>"How foolish your songs," said a lump of clay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What is there, I ask, to prove them?</span><br />
Just look at the walls between you and the day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now, have you the strength to move them?"</span></p>

<p>But under the ice and under the snow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pale little sprout kept singing,</span><br />
"I cannot tell how, but I know, I know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I know what the days are bringing."</span></p>

<p>"Birds, and blossoms, and buzzing bees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blue, blue skies above me,</span><br />
Bloom on the meadows and buds on the trees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the great glad sun to love me."</span></p>

<p>A pebble spoke next: "You are quite absurd."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It said, "with your song's insistence;</span><br />
For <i>I</i> never saw a tree or a bird,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So of course there are none in existence."</span></p>

<p>"But I know, I know," the tendril cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In beautiful sweet unreason;</span><br />

Can take from the immortal soul the need<br />

Of dead beliefs we cherished in our youth<br />
Fades but to let us welcome new-born Truth.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Man may not worship at the ancient shrine</span><br />
Prone on his face, in self-accusing scorn.<br />
That night is past. He hails a fairer morn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And knows himself a something all divine;</span><br />
No humble worm whose heritage is sin,<br />
But, born of God, he feels the Christ within.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not loud his prayers, as in the olden time,</span><br />
But deep his reverence for that mighty force.<br />
That occult working of the great all Source,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which makes the present era so sublime.</span><br />
Religion now means something high and broad,<br />
And man stood never half so near to God.</p>

Through all our search for worldly gains and treasures,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There walketh one whom no man likes to name.</span><br />
Silent he follows, veiled of form and feature,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Indifferent if we sorrow or rejoice,</span><br />
Yet that day comes when every living creature<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Must look upon his face and hear his voice.</span></p>

<p>When that day comes to you, and Death, unmasking,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall bar your path, and say, "Behold the end,"</span><br />
What are the questions that he will be asking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">About your past? Have you considered, friend?</span><br />
I think he will not chide you for your sinning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor for your creeds or dogmas will he care;</span><br />
He will but ask, "<i>From your life's first beginning</i><br />

<p>Deeper and deeper I seem to see<br />
Why and wherefore it has to be.</p>

<p>Only after the dark, wet days<br />
Do we fully rejoice in the sun's bright rays.</p>

<p>Sweeter the crust tastes after the fast<br />
Than the sated gourmand's finest repast.</p>

<p>The faintest cheer sounds never amiss<br />
To the actor who once has heard a hiss.</p>

<p>To one who the sadness of freedom knows,<br />
Light seem the fetters love may impose.</p>

<p>And he who has dwelt with his heart alone,<br />
Hears all the music in friendship's tone.</p>

<p>So better and better I comprehend,<br />
How sorrow ever would be our friend.</p>

<p>Not the rich and the poor, for to rate a man's wealth,<br />
You must first know the state of his conscience and health.</p>

<p>Not the humble and proud, for in life's little span,<br />
Who puts on vain airs, is not counted a man.</p>

<p>Not the happy and sad, for the swift flying years<br />
Bring each man his laughter and each man his tears.</p>

<p>No; the two kinds of people on earth I mean,<br />
Are the people who lift, and the people who lean.</p>

<p>Wherever you go, you will find the earth's masses,<br />
Are always divided in just these two classes.</p>

There's only one lifter to twenty who lean.</p>

<h2><a name="Music_In_The_Flat" id="Music_In_The_Flat"></a><b>Music In The Flat</b></h2>


<p>When Tom and I were married, we took a little flat;<br />
I had a taste for singing and playing and all that.<br />
And Tom, who loved to hear me, said he hoped I would not stop<br />
All practice, like so many wives who let their music drop.<br />
So I resolved to set apart an hour or two each day<br />
To keeping vocal chords and hands in trim to sing and play.</p>

<p>The second morning I had been for half an hour or more<br />
At work on Haydn's masses, when a tap came at my door.<br />
A nurse who wore a dainty cap and apron, and a smile,<br />
Ran down to ask if I would cease my music for awhile.<br />
The lady in the flat above was very ill, she said,<br />
And the sound of my piano was distracting to her head.</p>

<p>A fortnight's exercises lost, ere I began them, when,<br />
The following morning at my door, there came that tap again;<br />
A woman with an anguished face implored me to forego<br />
My music for some days to come&mdash;a man was dead below.<br />
I shut down my piano till the corpse had left the house,<br />
And spoke to Tom in whispers and was quiet as a mouse.</p>

<p>A week of labor limbered up my stiffened hand and voice,<br />
I stole an extra hour from sleep, to practice and rejoice;<br />
When, ting-a-ling, the door-bell rang a discord in my trill&mdash;<br />
The baby in the flat across was very, very ill.<br />
For ten long days that infant's life was hanging by a thread,<br />
And all that time my instrument was silent as the dead.</p>

<p>So pain and death and sickness came in one perpetual row,<br />
When babies were not born above, then tenants died below.<br />
The funeral over underneath, some one fell ill on top,<br />
And begged me, for the love of God, to let my music drop.<br />
When trouble went not up or down, it stalked across the hall,<br />
And so in spite of my resolve, I do not play at all.</p>

<p>Once she may smile, or thrice, thy soul to fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In passing by, but when she turns her face,</span><br />
Thou must persist and seek her with desire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If thou wouldst win the favor of her grace.</span></p>

<p>And if, like some winged bird she cleaves the air,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And leaves thee spent and stricken on the earth,</span><br />
Still must thou strive to follow even there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That she may know thy valor and thy worth.</span></p>

<p>Then shall she come unveiling all her charms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Giving thee joy for pain, and smiles for tears;</span><br />
Then shalt thou clasp her with possessing arms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The while she murmurs music in thine ears.</span></p>

<p>But ere her kiss has faded from thy cheek,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She shall flee from thee over hill and glade,</span><br />

Want, Loneliness and Pain, those comrades true,</p>

<p>Who, masqueraded in the garb of foes<br />
For many a year, and filled my heart with dread.<br />
Yet fickle joys, like false, pretentious friends,<br />
Have proved less worthy than this trio. First,</p>

<p>Want taught me labor, led me up the steep<br />
And toilsome paths to hills of pure delight,<br />
Trod only by the feet that know fatigue,<br />
And yet press on until the heights appear.</p>

<p>Then loneliness and hunger of the heart<br />
Sent me upreaching to the realms of space,<br />
Till all the silences grew eloquent,<br />
And all their loving forces hailed me friend.</p>

<p>Last, pain taught prayer! placed in my hand the staff<br />
Of close communion with the over-soul,<br />
That I might lean upon it till the end,<br />
And find myself made strong for any strife.</p>

<p>And then these three who had pursued my steps<br />
Like stern, relentless foes, year after year,<br />
Unmasked, and turned their faces full on me,<br />
And lo! they were divinely beautiful,<br />
For through them shone the lustrous eyes of Love.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then life indeed, does pay.</span></p>

<p>If we can show one troubled heart the gain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That lies alway in loss,</span><br />
Why then, we too, are paid for all the pain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of bearing life's hard cross.</span></p>

<p>If some despondent soul to hope is stirred,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some sad lip made to smile,</span><br />
By any act of ours, or any word,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, life has been worth while.</span></p>

<h2><a name="Sestina" id="Sestina"></a><b>Sestina</b></h2>


<p>I wandered o'er the vast green plains of youth,<br />
And searched for Pleasure. On a distant height<br />
Fame's silhouette stood sharp against the skies.<br />
Beyond vast crowds that thronged a broad high-way<br />
I caught the glimmer of a golden goal,<br />
While from a blooming bower smiled siren Love.</p>

<p>Straight gazing in her eyes, I laughed at Love,<br />
With all the haughty insolence of youth,<br />
As past her bower I strode to seek my goal.<br />
"Now will I climb to glory's dizzy height,"<br />
I said, "for there above the common way<br />
Doth pleasure dwell companioned by the skies."</p>

<p>But when I reached that summit near the skies,<br />
So far from man I seemed, so far from Love&mdash;<br />
"Not here," I cried, "doth Pleasure find her way,"<br />
Seen from the distant borderland of youth.<br />
Fame smiles upon us from her sun-kissed height,<br />
But frowns in shadows when we reach the goal.</p>

<p>Then were mine eyes fixed on that glittering goal,<br />
Dear to all sense&mdash;sunk souls beneath the skies.<br />
Gold tempts the artist from the lofty height,<br />
Gold lures the maiden from the arms of Love,<br />
Gold buys the fresh ingenuous heart of youth,<br />
"And gold," I said, "will show me Pleasure's way."</p>

<p>But ah! the soil and discord of that way,<br />
Where savage hordes rushed headlong to the goal,<br />
Dead to the best impulses of their youth,<br />
Blind to the azure beauty of the skies;<br />
Dulled to the voice of conscience and of love,<br />
They wandered far from Truth's eternal height.</p>

<p>Then Truth spoke to me from that noble height,<br />
Saying: "Thou didst pass Pleasure on the way,<br />
She with the yearning eyes so full of Love,<br />
Whom thou disdained to seek for glory's goal."<br />
Two blending paths beneath God's arching skies<br />
Lead straight to Pleasure. Ah, blind heart of youth,<br />
Not up fame's height, not toward the base god's goal,<br />
Doth Pleasure make her way, but 'neath calm skies<br />
Where Duty walks with Love in endless youth.</p>

<p>The fields were bleak and sodden. Not a wing<br />
Or note enlivened the depressing wood,<br />
A soiled and sullen, stubborn snowdrift stood<br />
Beside the roadway. Winds came muttering<br />
Of storms to be, and brought the chilly sting<br />
Of icebergs in their breath. Stalled cattle mooed<br />
Forth plaintive pleadings for the earth's green food.<br />
No gleam, no hint of hope in anything.</p>

<p>The sky was blank and ashen, like the face<br />
Of some poor wretch who drains life's cup too fast.<br />
Yet, swaying to and fro, as if to fling<br />
About chilled Nature its lithe arms of grace,<br />
Smiling with promise in the wintry blast,<br />
The optimistic Willow spoke of spring.</p>

<p>Who thinks how desolate and strange<br />
To me must seem the autumn's change,<br />
When housed in attic or in chest,<br />
A lonely and unwilling guest,<br />
I lie through nights of bleak December,<br />
And think in silence, and remember.</p>

<p>I think of hempen fields, where I<br />
Once played with insects floating by,<br />
And joyed alike in sun and rain,<br />
Unconscious of approaching pain.<br />
I dwell upon my later lot,<br />
Where, swung in some secluded spot<br />
Between two tried and trusted trees,<br />
All summer long I wooed the breeze.<br />
With song of bee and call of bird<br />
And lover's secrets overheard,<br />
And sight and scent of blooming flowers,<br />
To fill the happy sunlight's hours.<br />
When verdant fields grow bare and brown,<br />
When forest leaves come raining down,<br />
When frost has mated with the weather<br />
And all the birds go south together,<br />
When drying boats turn up their keels,<br />
Who wonders how the hammock feels?</p>

<p>Let no man pray that he know not sorrow,<br />

For the gall of to-day is the sweet of to-morrow,<br />

<p>Through want of a thing does its worth redouble,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through hunger's pangs does the feast content,</span><br />
And only the heart that has harbored trouble,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can fully rejoice when joy is sent.</span></p>

<p>Let no man shrink from the bitter tonics<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of grief, and yearning, and need, and strife,</span><br />

It is easy to float in a well-trimmed boat,<br />

<p>As when the old moon lighted by the tender<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And radiant crescent of the new is seen,</span><br />
And for a moment's space suggests the splendor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of what in its full prime it once has been,</span><br />
So on my waning years you cast the glory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of youth and pleasure, for a little hour;</span><br />
And life again seems like an unread story,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And joy and hope both stir me with their power.</span></p>

<p>Can blooming June be fond of bleak December?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I dare not wait to hear my heart reply.</span><br />
I will forget the question&mdash;and remember<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Alone the priceless feast spread for mine eye,</span><br />
That radiant hair that flows across the pillows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like shimmering sunbeams over drifts of snow;</span><br />
Those heaving breasts, like undulating billows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose dangers or delights but Love can know.</span></p>

<p>That crimson mouth from which sly Cupid borrowed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pattern for his bow, nor asked consent;</span><br />
That smooth, unruffled brow which has not sorrowed&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All these are mine; should I not be content?</span><br />
Yet are these treasures mine, or only lent me?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And who shall claim them when I pass away?</span><br />
Oh, jealous Fate, to torture and torment me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With thoughts like these in my too fleeting day!</span></p>

<p>For while I gained the prize which all were seeking,<br />

E'en while I lean and count my riches over,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And view with gloating eyes your priceless charms,</span><br />

This unseen lover waits for such caresses<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As my poor hungering clay has never known,</span><br />
And when some day, between you and your duty<br />

<h3>(Suggested by the lives of Napoleon and Josephine.)</h3>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>One night was full of rapture and delight&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of reunited arms and swooning kisses,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the unnamed and unnumbered blisses</span><br />
Which fond souls find in love of love at night.</p>

<p>Heart beat with heart, and each clung into each<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With twining arms that did but loose their hold</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To cling still closer; and fond glances told</span><br />
These truths for which there is no uttered speech.</p>

<p>There was sweet laughter and endearing words,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made broken by the kiss that could not wait,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cooing sounds as of dear little birds</span><br />
That in spring-time love and woo and mate.</p>

<p>And languid sighs that breathed of love's content<br />
And all too soon this night of rapture went.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>One night was full of anguish and of pain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of nerveless arms and mockery of kisses;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And those caresses where one sick heart misses</span><br />
The quick response the other cannot feign.</p>

<p>Hands idly clasped and unclasped, and lost hold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the averted eyes, that turned away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in whose depths no love nor longing lay,</span><br />
The saddest of all truths too plainly told.</p>

<p>There was salt sorrow and the gall of tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some useless words that ended in a moan,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a dull dread of long unending years</span><br />
When one must walk forever more alone.<br />
Deep shuddering sighs told more than lips could say;<br />
And the long night of sorrow wore away.</p>

<h2><a name="Preparation" id="Preparation"></a><b>Preparation</b></h2>


<p>We must not force events, but rather make<br />
The heart soil ready for their coming, as<br />
The earth spreads carpets for the feet of Spring,<br />
Or, with the strengthening tonic of the frost,<br />
Prepares for Winter. Should a July noon<br />
Burst suddenly upon a frozen world<br />
Small joy would follow, even tho' that world<br />
Were longing for the Summer. Should the sting<br />
Of sharp December pierce the heart of June,<br />
What death and devastation would ensue!<br />
All things are planned. The most majestic sphere<br />
That whirls through space is governed and controlled<br />
By supreme law, as is the blade of grass<br />
Which through the bursting bosom of the earth<br />
Creeps up to kiss the light. Poor puny man<br />
Alone doth strive and battle with the Force<br />
Which rules all lives and worlds, and he alone<br />
Demands effect before producing cause.<br />
How vain the hope! We cannot harvest joy<br />
Until we sow the seed, and God alone<br />
Knows when that seed has ripened. Oft we stand<br />
And watch the ground with anxious brooding eyes<br />
Complaining of the slow unfruitful yield,<br />
Not knowing that the shadow of ourselves<br />
Keeps off the sunlight and delays result.<br />
Sometimes our fierce impatience of desire<br />
Doth like a sultry May force tender shoots<br />
Of half-formed pleasures and unshaped events<br />
To ripen prematurely, and we reap<br />
But disappointment; or we rot the germs<br />
With briny tears ere they have time to grow.<br />
While stars are born and mighty planets die<br />
And hissing comets scorch the brow of space<br />
The Universe keeps its eternal calm.<br />
Through patient preparation, year on year,<br />
The earth endures the travail of the Spring<br />
And Winter's desolation. So our souls<br />
In grand submission to a higher law<br />
Should move serene through all the ills of life,<br />
Believing them masked joys.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>All valor died not on the plains of Troy.<br />
Awake, my Muse, awake! be thine the joy<br />
To sing of deeds as dauntless and as brave<br />
As e'er lent luster to a warrior's grave.<br />
Sing of that noble soldier, nobler man,<br />
Dear to the heart of each American.<br />
Sound forth his praise from sea to listening sea&mdash;<br />
Greece her Achilles claimed, immortal Custer, we.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Intrepid are earth's heroes now as when<br />
The gods came down to measure strength with men.<br />
Let danger threaten or let duty call,<br />
And self surrenders to the needs of all;<br />
Incurs vast perils, or, to save those dear,<br />
Embraces death without one sigh or tear.<br />
Life's martyrs still the endless drama play<br />
Though no great Homer lives to chant their worth to-day.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>And if he chanted, who would list his songs,<br />
So hurried now the world's gold-seeking throngs?<br />
And yet shall silence mantle mighty deeds?<br />
Awake, dear Muse, and sing though no ear heeds!<br />
Extol the triumphs, and bemoan the end<br />
Of that true hero, lover, son and friend<br />
Whose faithful heart in his last choice was shown&mdash;<br />
Death with the comrades dear, refusing flight alone.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>He who was born for battle and for strife<br />
Like some caged eagle frets in peaceful life;<br />
So Custer fretted when detained afar<br />
From scenes of stirring action and of war.<br />
And as the captive eagle in delight,<br />
When freedom offers, plumes himself for flight<br />
And soars away to thunder clouds on high,<br />
With palpitating wings and wild exultant cry.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>So lion-hearted Custer sprang to arms,<br />
And gloried in the conflict's loud alarms.<br />
But one dark shadow marred his bounding joy;<br />
And then the soldier vanished, and the boy,<br />
The tender son, clung close, with sobbing breath,<br />
To her from whom each parting was new death;<br />
That mother who like goddesses of old,<br />
Gave to the mighty Mars, three warriors brave and bold,</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Yet who, unlike those martial dames of yore,<br />
Grew pale and shuddered at the sight of gore.<br />
A fragile being, born to grace the hearth,<br />
Untroubled by the conflicts of the earth.<br />
Some gentle dove who reared young eaglets, might,<br />
In watching those bold birdlings take their flight,<br />
Feel what that mother felt who saw her sons<br />
Rush from her loving arms, to face death-dealing guns.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>But ere thy lyre is strung to martial strains<br />
Of wars which sent our hero o'er the plains,<br />
To add the cypress to his laureled brow,<br />
Be brave, my Muse, and darker truths avow.<br />
Let Justice ask a preface to thy songs,<br />
Before the Indian's crimes declare his wrongs;<br />
Before effects, wherein all horrors blend,<br />
Declare the shameful cause, precursor of the end.</p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>When first this soil the great Columbus trod,<br />
He was less like the image of his God<br />
Than those ingenuous souls, unspoiled by art,<br />
Who lived so near to Mother Nature's heart;<br />
Those simple children of the wood and wave,<br />
As frank as trusting, and as true as brave;<br />
Savage they were, when on some hostile raid<br />
(For where is he so high, whom war does not degrade?)</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>But dark deceit and falsehood's shameless shame<br />
They had not learned, until the white man came.<br />
He taught them, too, the lurking devil's joy<br />
In liquid lies, that lure but to destroy.<br />
With wily words, as false as they were sweet,<br />
He spread his snares for unsuspecting feet;<br />
Paid truth with guile, and trampled in the dust<br />
Their gentle childlike faith and unaffected trust.</p>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p>And for the sport of idle kings and knaves<br />
Of Nature's greater noblemen, made slaves.<br />
Alas, the hour, when the wronged Indian knows<br />
His seeming benefactors are but foes.<br />
His kinsmen kidnapped and his lands possessed,<br />
The demon woke in that untutored breast.<br />
Four hundred years have rolled upon their way&mdash;<br />
The ruthless demon rules the red man to this day.</p>


<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>If, in the morning of success, that grand<br />
Invincible discoverer of our land<br />
Had made no lodge or wigwam desolate<br />
To carry trophies to the proud and great;<br />
If on our history's page there were no blot<br />
Left by the cruel rapine of Cabot,<br />
Of Verrazin, and Hudson, dare we claim<br />
The Indian of the plains, to-day had been the same?</p>


<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>For in this brief existence, not alone<br />
Do our lives gather what our hands have sown,<br />
But we reap, too, what others long ago<br />
Sowed, careless of the harvests that might grow.<br />
Thus hour by hour the humblest human souls<br />
Inscribe in cipher on unending scrolls,<br />
The history of nations yet to be;<br />
Incite fierce bloody wars, to rage from sea to sea,</p>


<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>Or pave the way to peace. There is no past,<br />
So deathless are events&mdash;results so vast.<br />
And he who strives to make one act or hour<br />
Stand separate and alone, needs first the power<br />
To look upon the breaking wave and say,<br />
"These drops were bosomed by a cloud to-day,<br />
And those from far mid-ocean's crest were sent."<br />
So future, present, past, in one wide sea are blent.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Oh, for the power to call to aid, of mine<br />
Own humble Muse, the famed and sacred nine.<br />
Then might she fitly sing, and only then,<br />
Of those intrepid and unflinching men<br />
Who knew no homes save ever moving tents,<br />
And who 'twixt fierce unfriendly elements<br />
And wild barbarians warred. Yet unfraid,<br />
Since love impels thy strains, sing, sing, my modest maid.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Relate how Custer in midwinter sought<br />
Far Washita's cold shores; tell why he fought<br />
With savage nomads fortressed in deep snows.<br />
Woman, thou source of half the sad world's woes<br />
And all its joys, what sanguinary strife<br />
Has vexed the earth and made contention rife<br />
Because of thee! For, hidden in man's heart,<br />
Ay, in his very soul, of his true self a part,</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The natural impulse and the wish belongs<br />
To win thy favor and redress thy wrongs.<br />
Alas! for woman, and for man, alas!<br />
If that dread hour should ever come to pass,<br />
When, through her new-born passion for control,<br />
She drives that beauteous impulse from his soul.<br />
What were her vaunted independence worth<br />
If to obtain she sells her sweetest rights of birth?</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>God formed fair woman for her true estate&mdash;<br />
Man's tender comrade, and his equal mate,<br />
Not his competitor in toil and trade.<br />
While coarser man, with greater strength was made<br />
To fight her battles and her rights protect.<br />
Ay! to protect the rights of earth's elect<br />
(The virgin maiden and the spotless wife)<br />
From immemorial time has man laid down his life.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>And now brave Custer's valiant army pressed<br />
Across the dangerous desert of the West,<br />
To rescue fair white captives from the hands<br />
Of brutal Cheyenne and Comanche bands,<br />
On Washita's bleak banks. Nine hundred strong<br />
It moved its slow determined way along,<br />
Past frontier homes left dark and desolate<br />
By the wild Indians' fierce and unrelenting hate;</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Past forts where ranchmen, strong of heart and bold,<br />
Wept now like orphaned children as they told,<br />
With quivering muscles and with anguished breath,<br />
Of captured wives, whose fate was worse than death;<br />
Past naked bodies whose disfiguring wounds<br />
Spoke of the hellish hate of human hounds;<br />
Past bleaching skeleton and rifled grave,<br />
On pressed th' avenging host, to rescue and to save.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Uncertain Nature, like a fickle friend,<br />
(Worse than the foe on whom we may depend)<br />
Turned on these dauntless souls a brow of wrath<br />
And hurled her icy jav'lins in their path.<br />
With treacherous quicksands, and with storms that blight,<br />
Entrapped their footsteps and confused their sight.<br />
"Yet on," urged Custer, "on at any cost,<br />
No hour is there to waste, no moment to be lost."</p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>Determined, silent, on they rode, and on,<br />
Like fabled Centaurs, men and steeds seemed one.<br />
No bugle echoed and no voice spoke near,<br />
Lest on some lurking Indian's list'ning ear<br />
The sound might fall. Through swift descending snow<br />
The stealthy guides crept, tracing out the foe;<br />
No fire was lighted, and no halt was made<br />
From haggard gray-lipped dawn till night lent friendly shade.</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>Then, by the shelt'ring river's bank at last,<br />
The weary warriors paused for their repast.<br />
A couch of ice and falling snows for spread<br />
Made many a suffering soldier's chilling bed.<br />
They slept to dream of glory and delight,<br />
While the pale fingers of the pitying night<br />
Wove ghostly winding sheets for that doomed score<br />
Who, ere another eve, should sleep to wake no more.</p>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p>But those who slept not, saw with startled eyes<br />
Far off, athwart dim unprotecting skies,<br />
Ascending slowly with majestic grace,<br />
A lustrous rocket, rising out of space.<br />
"Behold the signal of the foe," cried one,<br />
The field is lost before the strife's begun.<br />
Yet no! for see! yon rays spread near and far;<br />
It is the day's first smile, the radiant morning star.</p>


<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>The long hours counting till the daylight broke,<br />
In whispered words the restless warriors spoke.<br />
They talked of battles, but they thought of home<br />
(For hearts are faithful though the feet may roam).<br />
Brave Hamilton, all eager for the strife,<br />
Mused o'er that two-fold mystery&mdash;death and life;<br />
"And when I die," quoth he, "mine be the part<br />
To fall upon the field, a bullet in my heart."</p>


<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>At break of dawn the scouts crept in to say<br />
The foe was camped a rifle shot away.<br />
The baying of a dog, an infant's cry<br />
Pierced through the air; sleep fled from every eye.<br />
To horse! to arms! the dead demand the dead!<br />
Let the grand charge upon the lodge be led!<br />
Let the Mosaic law, life for a life<br />
Pay the long standing debt of blood. War to the knife!</p>


<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>So spake each heart in that unholy rage<br />
Which fires the brain, when war the thoughts engage.<br />
War, hideous war, appealing to the worst<br />
In complex man, and waking that wild thirst<br />
For human blood which blood alone can slake.<br />
Yet for their country's safety, and the sake<br />
Of tortured captives moaning in alarm<br />
The Indian must be made to fear the law's strong arm.</p>


<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p>A noble vengeance burned in Custer's breast,<br />
But, as he led his army to the crest,<br />
Above the wigwams, ready for the charge<br />
He felt the heart within him, swelling large<br />
With human pity, as an infant's wail<br />
Shrilled once again above the wintry gale.<br />
Then hosts of murdered children seemed to rise;<br />
And shame his halting thought with sad accusing eyes,</p>


<h3>XV.</h3>

<p>And urge him on to action. Stern of brow<br />
The just avenger, and the General now,<br />
He gives the silent signal to the band<br />
Which, all impatient, waits for his command.<br />
Cold lips to colder metal press; the air<br />
Echoes those merry strains which mean despair<br />
For sleeping chieftain and for toiling squaw,<br />
But joy to those stern hearts which glory in the law</p>


<h3>XVI.</h3>

<p>Of murder paying murder's awful debt.<br />
And now four squadrons in one charge are met.<br />
From east and west, from north and south they come,<br />
At call of bugle and at roll of drum.<br />
Their rifles rain hot hail upon the foe,<br />
Who flee from danger in death's jaws to go.<br />
The Indians fight like maddened bulls at bay,<br />
And dying shriek and groan, wound the young ear of day.</p>


<h3>XVII.</h3>

<p>A pallid captive and a white-browed boy<br />
Add to the tumult piercing cries of joy,<br />
As forth they fly, with high hope animate.<br />
A hideous squaw pursues them with her hate;<br />
Her knife descends with sickening force and sound;<br />
Their bloody entrails stain the snow-clad ground.<br />
She shouts with glee, then yells with rage and falls<br />
Dead by her victims' side, pierced by avenging balls.</p>


<h3>XVIII.</h3>

<p>Now war runs riot, carnage reigns supreme.<br />
All thoughts of mercy fade from Custer's scheme.<br />
Inhuman methods for inhuman foes,<br />
Who feed on horrors and exult in woes.<br />
To conquer and subdue alone remains<br />
In dealing with the red man on the plains.<br />
The breast that knows no conscience yields to fear,<br />
Strike! let the Indian meet his master now and here.</p>


<h3>XIX.</h3>

<p>With thoughts like these was Custer's mind engaged.<br />
The gentlest are the sternest when enraged.<br />
All felt the swift contagion of his ire,<br />
For he was one who could arouse and fire<br />
The coldest heart, so ardent was his own.<br />
His fearless eye, his calm intrepid tone,<br />
Bespoke the leader, strong with conscious power,<br />
Whom following friends will bless, while foes will curse and cower.</p>


<h3>XX.</h3>

<p>Again they charge! and now among the killed<br />
Lies Hamilton, his wish so soon fulfilled,<br />
Brave Elliott pursues across the field<br />
The flying foe, his own young life to yield.<br />
But like the leaves in some autumnal gale<br />
The red men fall in Washita's wild vale.<br />
Each painted face and black befeathered head<br />
Still more repulsive seems with death's grim pallor wed.</p>


<h3>XXI.</h3>

<p>New forces gather on surrounding knolls,<br />
And fierce and fiercer war's red river rolls.<br />
With bright-hued pennants flying from each lance<br />
The gayly costumed Kiowas advance.<br />
And bold Comanches (Bedouins of the land)<br />
Infuse fresh spirit in the Cheyenne band.<br />
While from the ambush of some dark ravine<br />
Flash arrows aimed by hands, unerring and unseen.</p>


<h3>XXIII.</h3>

<p>The hours advance; the storm clouds roll away;<br />
Still furious and more furious grows the fray.<br />
The yellow sun makes ghastlier still the sight<br />
Of painted corpses, staring in its light.<br />
No longer slaves, but comrades of their griefs,<br />
The squaws augment the forces of their chiefs.<br />
They chant weird dirges in a minor key,<br />
While from the narrow door of wigwam and tepee</p>

<p>[Transcriber's Note: originally the remaining stanzas
of Book II were numbered incorrectly from here onwards.
This has been changed to avoid confusion]</p>


<h3>XXIV.</h3>

<p>Cold glittering eyes above cold glittering steel<br />
Their deadly purpose and their hate reveal.<br />
The click of pistols and the crack of guns<br />
Proclaim war's daughters dangerous as her sons.<br />
She who would wield the soldier's sword and lance<br />
Must be prepared to take the soldier's chance.<br />
She who would shoot must serve as target, too;<br />
The battle-frenzied men, infuriate now pursue.</p>


<h3>XXV.</h3>

<p>And blood of warrior, woman and papoose,<br />
Flow free as waters when some dam breaks loose;<br />
Consuming fire, the wanton friend of war<br />
(Whom allies worship and whom foes abhor)<br />
Now trails her crimson garments through the street,<br />
And ruin marks the passing of her feet.<br />
Full three-score lodges smoke upon the plain,<br />
And all the vale is strewn with bodies of the slain.</p>


<h3>XXVI.</h3>

<p>And those who are not numbered with the dead<br />
Before all-conquering Custer now are led.<br />
To soothe their woes, and calm their fears he seeks;<br />
An Osage guide interprets while he speaks.<br />
The vanquished captives, humbled, cowed and spent<br />
Read in the victor's eye his kind intent.<br />
The modern victor is as kind as brave;<br />
His captive is his guest, not his insulted slave.</p>


<h3>XXVII.</h3>

<p>Mahwissa, sister of the slaughtered chief<br />
Of all the Cheyennes, listens; and her grief<br />
Yields now to hope; and o'er her withered face<br />
There flits the stealthy cunning of her race.<br />
Then forth she steps, and thus begins to speak:<br />
"To aid the fallen and support the weak<br />
Is man's true province; and to ease the pain<br />
Of those o'er whom it is his purpose now to reign.</p>


<h3>XXVIII.</h3>

<p>"Let the strong chief unite with theirs his life,<br />
And take this black-eyed maiden for a wife."<br />
Then, moving with an air of proud command,<br />
She leads a dusky damsel by the hand,<br />
And places her at wondering Custer's side,<br />
Invoking choicest blessings on the bride<br />
And all unwilling groom, who thus replies.<br />
"Fair is the Indian maid, with bright bewildering eyes,</p>


<h3>XXIX.</h3>

<p>"But fairer still is one who, year on year,<br />
Has borne man's burdens, conquered woman's fear;<br />
And at my side rode mile on weary mile,<br />
And faced all deaths, all dangers, with a smile,<br />
Wise as Minerva, as Diana brave,<br />
Is she whom generous gods in kindness gave<br />
To share the hardships of my wandering life,<br />
Companion, comrade, friend, my loved and loyal wife.</p>


<h3>XXX.</h3>

<p>"The white chief weds but one. Take back thy maid."<br />
He ceased, and o'er Mahwissa's face a shade<br />
Of mingled scorn and pity and surprise<br />
Sweeps as she slow retreats, and thus replies:<br />
"Rich is the pale-faced chief in battle fame,<br />
But poor is he who but one wife may claim.<br />
Wives are the red-skinned heroes' rightful spoil;<br />
In war they prove his strength, in times of peace they toil."</p>


<h3>XXXI.</h3>

<p>But hark! The bugle echoes o'er the plains<br />
And sounds again those merry Celtic strains<br />
Which oft have called light feet to lilting dance,<br />
But now they mean the order to advance.<br />
Along the river's bank, beyond the hill<br />
Two thousand foemen lodge, unconquered still.<br />
Ere falls night's curtain on this bloody play,<br />
The army must proceed, with feint of further fray.</p>


<h3>XXXII.</h3>

<p>The weary warriors mount their foam-flecked steeds,<br />
With flags unfurled the dauntless host proceeds.<br />
What though the foe outnumbers two to one?<br />
Boldness achieves what strength oft leaves undone;<br />
A daring mein will cause brute force to cower,<br />
And courage is the secret source of power.<br />
As Custer's column wheels upon their sight<br />
The frightened red men yield the untried field by flight.</p>


<h3>XXXIII.</h3>

<p>Yet when these conquering heroes sink to rest,<br />
Dissatisfaction gnaws the leader's breast,<br />
For far away across vast seas of snows<br />
Held prisoners still by hostile Arapahoes<br />
And Cheyennes unsubdued, two captives wait.<br />
On God and Custer hangs their future fate.<br />
May the Great Spirit nerve the mortal's arm<br />
To rescue suffering souls from worse than death's alarm.</p>


<h3>XXXIV.</h3>

<p>But ere they seek to rescue the oppressed,<br />
The valiant dead, in state, are laid to rest.<br />
Mourned Hamilton, the faithful and the brave,<br />
Nine hundred comrades follow to the grave;<br />
And close behind the banner-hidden corse<br />
All draped in black, walks mournfully his horse;<br />
While tears of sound drip through the sunlit day.<br />
A soldier may not weep, but drums and bugles may.</p>


<h3>XXXV.</h3>

<p>Now, Muse, recount, how after long delays<br />
And dangerous marches through untrodden ways,<br />
Where cold and hunger on each hour attend,<br />
At last the army gains the journey's end.<br />
An Indian village bursts upon the eye;<br />
Two hundred lodges, sleep-encompassed lie,<br />
There captives moan their anguished prayers through tears,<br />
While in the silent dawn the armied answer nears.</p>


<h3>XXXVI.</h3>

<p>To snatch two fragile victims from the foe<br />
Nine hundred men have traversed leagues of snow.<br />
Each woe they suffered in a hostile land<br />
The flame of vengeance in their bosoms fanned.<br />
They thirst for slaughter, and the signal wait<br />
To wrest the captives from their horrid fate.<br />
Each warrior's hand upon his rifle falls,<br />
Each savage soldier's heart for awful bloodshed calls.</p>


<h3>XXXVII.</h3>

<p>And one, in years a youth, in woe a man,<br />
Sad Brewster, scarred by sorrow's blighting ban,<br />
Looks, panting, where his captive sister sleeps,<br />
And o'er his face the shade of murder creeps.<br />
His nostrils quiver like a hungry beast<br />
Who scents anear the bloody carnal feast.<br />
He longs to leap down in that slumbering vale<br />
And leave no foe alive to tell the awful tale.</p>


<h3>XXXVIII.</h3>

<p>Not so, calm Custer. Sick of gory strife,<br />
He hopes for rescue with no loss of life;<br />
And plans that bloodless battle of the plains<br />
Where reasoning mind outwits mere savage brains.<br />
The sullen soldiers follow where he leads;<br />
No gun is emptied, and no foeman bleeds.<br />
Fierce for the fight and eager for the fray<br />
They look upon their Chief in undisguised dismay.</p>


<h3>XXXIX.</h3>

<p>He hears the murmur of their discontent,<br />
But sneers can never change a strong mind's bent.<br />
He knows his purpose and he does not swerve,<br />
And with a quiet mien and steady nerve<br />
He meets dark looks where'er his steps may go,<br />
And silence that is bruising as a blow,<br />
Where late were smiles and words of ardent praise.<br />
So pass the lagging weeks of wearying delays.</p>


<h3>XL.</h3>

<p>Inaction is not always what it seems,<br />
And Custer's mind with plan and project teems.<br />
Fixed in his peaceful purpose he abides<br />
With none takes counsel and in none confides;<br />
But slowly weaves about the foe a net<br />
Which leaves them wholly at his mercy, yet<br />
He strikes no fateful blow; he takes no life,<br />
And holds in check his men, who pant for bloody strife.</p>


<h3>XLI.</h3>

<p>Intrepid warrior and skilled diplomate,<br />
In his strong hands he holds the red man's fate.<br />
The craftiest plot he checks with counterplot,<br />
Till tribe by tribe the tricky foe is brought<br />
To fear his vengeance and to know his power<br />
As man's fixed gaze will make a wild beast cower,<br />
So these crude souls feel that unflinching will<br />
Which draws them by its force, yet does not deign to kill.</p>


<h3>XLII.</h3>

<p>And one by one the hostile Indians send<br />
Their chiefs to seek a peaceful treaty's end.<br />
Great councils follow; skill with cunning copes<br />
And conquers it; and Custer sees his hopes<br />
So long delayed, like stars storm hidden, rise<br />
To radiate with splendor all his skies.<br />
The stubborn Cheyennes, cowed at last by fear,<br />
Leading the captive pair, o'er spring-touched hills appear.</p>


<h3>XLIII.</h3>

<p>With breath suspended, now the whole command<br />
Waits the approach of that equestrian band.<br />
Nearer it comes, still nearer, then a cry,<br />
Half sob, half shriek, goes piercing God's blue sky,<br />
And Brewster, like a nimble-footed doe,<br />
Or like an arrow hurrying from a bow,<br />
Shoots swiftly through the intervening space<br />
And that lost sister clasps, in sorrowing love's embrace.</p>


<h3>XLIV.</h3>

<p>And men who leaned o'er Hamilton's rude bier<br />
And saw his dead dear face without a tear,<br />
Strong souls who early learned the manly art<br />
Of keeping from the eye what's in the heart,<br />
Soldiers who look unmoved on death's pale brow,<br />
Avert their eyes, to hide their moisture now.<br />
The briny flood forced back from shores of woe,<br />
Needs but to touch the strands of joy to overflow.</p>


<h3>XLV.</h3>

<p>About the captives welcoming warriors crowd,<br />
All eyes are wet, and Brewster sobs aloud.<br />
Alas, the ravage wrought by toil and woe<br />
On faces that were fair twelve moons ago.<br />
Bronzed by exposure to the heat and cold,<br />
Still young in years, yet prematurely old,<br />
By insults humbled and by labor worn,<br />
They stand in youth's bright hour, of all youth's graces shorn.</p>


<h3>XLVI.</h3>

<p>A scanty garment rudely made of sacks<br />
Hangs from their loins; bright blankets drape their backs;<br />
About their necks are twisted tangled strings<br />
Of gaudy beads, while tinkling wire and rings<br />
Of yellow brass on wrists and fingers glow.<br />
Thus, to assuage the anger of the foe<br />
The cunning Indians decked the captive pair<br />
Who in one year have known a lifetime of despair.</p>


<h3>XLVII.</h3>

<p>But love can resurrect from sorrow's tomb<br />
The vanished beauty and the faded bloom,<br />
As sunlight lifts the bruised flower from the sod,<br />
Can lift crushed hearts to hope, for love is God.<br />
Already now in freedom's glad release<br />
The hunted look of fear gives place to peace,<br />
And in their eyes at thought of home appears<br />
That rainbow light of joy which brightest shines through tears.</p>


<h3>XLVIII.</h3>

<p>About the leader thick the warriors crowd;<br />
Late loud in censure, now in praises loud,<br />
They laud the tactics, and the skill extol<br />
Which gained a bloodless yet a glorious goal.<br />
Alone and lonely in the path of right<br />
Full many a brave soul walks. When gods requite<br />
And crown his actions as their worth demands,<br />
Among admiring throngs the hero always stands.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%; Margin-left: 1em; Margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 3em;" />


<h3>XLIX.</h3>

<p>Back to the East the valorous squadrons sweep;<br />
The earth, arousing from her long, cold sleep,<br />
Throws from her breast the coverlet of snow,<br />
Revealing Spring's soft charms which lie below.<br />
Suppressed emotions in each heart arise,<br />
The wooer wakens and the warrior dies.<br />
The bird of prey is vanquished by the dove,<br />
And thoughts of bloody strife give place to thoughts of love.</p>


<h3>L.</h3>

<p>The mighty plains, devoid of whispering trees,<br />
Guard well the secrets of departed seas.<br />
Where once great tides swept by with ebb and flow<br />
The scorching sun looks down in tearless woe.<br />
And fierce tornadoes in ungoverned pain<br />
Mourn still the loss of that mysterious main.<br />
Across this ocean bed the soldiers fly&mdash;<br />
Home is the gleaming goal that lures each eager eye.</p>


<h3>LI.</h3>

<p>Like some elixir which the gods prepare,<br />
They drink the viewless tonic of the air,<br />
Sweet with the breath of startled antelopes<br />
Which speed before them over swelling slopes.<br />
Now like a serpent writhing o'er the moor,<br />
The column curves and makes a slight detour,<br />
As Custer leads a thousand men away<br />
To save a ground bird's nest which in the footpath lay.</p>


<h3>LII.</h3>

<p>Mile following mile, against the leaning skies<br />
Far off they see a dull dark cloud arise.<br />
The hunter's instinct in each heart is stirred,<br />
Beholding there in one stupendous herd<br />
A hundred thousand buffaloes. Oh great<br />
Unwieldy proof of Nature's cruder state,<br />
Rough remnant of a prehistoric day,<br />
Thou, with the red man, too, must shortly pass away.</p>


<h3>LIII.</h3>

<p>Upon those spreading plains is there not room<br />
For man and bison, that he seals its doom?<br />
What pleasure lies and what seductive charm<br />
In slaying with no purpose but to harm?<br />
Alas, that man, unable to create,<br />
Should thirst forever to exterminate,<br />
And in destruction find his fiercest joy.<br />
The gods alone create, gods only should destroy.</p>


<h3>LIV.</h3>

<p>The flying hosts a straggling bull pursue;<br />
Unerring aim, the skillful Custer drew.<br />
The wounded beast turns madly in despair<br />
And man and horse are lifted high in air.<br />
The conscious steed needs not the guiding rein;<br />
Back with a bound and one quick cry of pain<br />
He springs, and halts, well knowing where must fall<br />
In that protected frame, the sure death dealing ball.</p>


<h3>LV.</h3>

<p>With minds intent upon the morrow's feast,<br />
The men surround the carcass of the beast.<br />
Rolled on his back, he lies with lolling tongue,<br />
Soon to the saddle savory steaks are hung.<br />
And from his mighty head, great tufts of hair<br />
Are cut as trophies for some lady fair.<br />
To vultures then they leave the torn remains<br />
Of what an hour ago was monarch of the plains.</p>


<h3>LVI.</h3>

<p>Far off, two bulls in jealous war engage,<br />
Their blood-shot eye balls roll in furious rage;<br />
With maddened hoofs they mutilate the ground<br />
And loud their angry bellowings resound;<br />
With shaggy heads bent low they plunge and roar,<br />
Till both broad bellies drip with purple gore.<br />
Meanwhile, the heifer, whom the twain desire,<br />
Stands browsing near the pair, indifferent to their ire.</p>


<h3>LVII.</h3>

<p>At last she lifts her lazy head and heeds<br />
The clattering hoofs of swift advancing steeds.<br />
Off to the herd with cumb'rous gait she runs<br />
And leaves the bulls to face the threatening guns.<br />
No more for them the free life of the plains,<br />
Its mating pleasures and its warring pains.<br />
Their quivering flesh shall feed unnumbered foes,<br />
Their tufted tails adorn the soldiers' saddle bows.</p>


<h3>LVIII.</h3>

<p>Now into camp the conquering hosts advance;<br />
On burnished arms the brilliant sunbeams glance.<br />
Brave Custer leads, blonde as the gods of old;<br />
Back from his brow blow clustering locks of gold,<br />
And, like a jewel in a brook, there lies,<br />
Far in the depths of his blue guarded eyes,<br />
The thought of one whose smiling lips up-curled,<br />
Mean more of joy to him than plaudits of the world.</p>


<h3>LIX.</h3>

<p>The troops in columns of platoons appear<br />
Close to the leader following. Ah, here<br />
The poetry of war is fully seen,<br />
Its prose forgotten; as against the green<br />
Of Mother Nature, uniformed in blue,<br />
The soldiers pass for Sheridan's review.<br />
The motion-music of the moving throng,<br />
Is like a silent tune, set to a wordless song.</p>


<h3>LX.</h3>

<p>The guides and trailers, weird in war's array,<br />
Precede the troops along the grassy way.<br />
They chant wild songs, and with loud noise and stress,<br />
In savage manner savage joy express.<br />
The Indian captives, blanketed in red,<br />
On ponies mounted, by the scouts are led.<br />
Like sumach bushes, etched on evening skies,<br />
Against the blue-clad troops, this patch of color lies.</p>


<h3>LXI.</h3>

<p>High o'er the scene vast music billows bound,<br />
And all the air is liquid with the sound<br />
Of those invisible compelling waves.<br />
Perchance they reach the low and lonely graves<br />
Where sleep brave Elliott and Hamilton,<br />
And whisper there the tale of victory won;<br />
Or do the souls of soldiers tried and true<br />
Come at the bugle call, and march in grand review?</p>


<h3>LXII.</h3>

<p>The pleased Commander watches in surprise<br />
This splendid pageant surge before his eyes.<br />
Not in those mighty battle days of old<br />
Did scenes like this upon his sight unfold.<br />
But now it passes. Drums and bugles cease<br />
To dash war billows on the shores of Peace.<br />
The victors smile on fair broad bosomed Sleep<br />
While in her soothing arms, the vanquished cease to weep.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="BOOK_THIRD" id="BOOK_THIRD"></a>BOOK THIRD.</h2>

<p>[There is an interval of eight years between Books Second and Third.]</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>As in the long dead days marauding hosts<br />
Of Indians came from far Siberian coasts,<br />
And drove the peaceful Aztecs from their grounds,<br />
Despoiled their homes (but left their tell-tale mounds),<br />
So has the white man with the Indians done.<br />
Now with their backs against the setting sun<br />
The remnants of a dying nation stand<br />
And view the lost domain, once their beloved land.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Upon the vast Atlantic's leagues of shore<br />
The happy red man's tent is seen no more;<br />
And from the deep blue lakes which mirror heaven<br />
His bounding bark canoe was long since driven.<br />
The mighty woods, those temples where his God<br />
Spoke to his soul, are leveled to the sod;<br />
And in their place tall church spires point above,<br />
While priests proclaim the law of Christ, the King of Love.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The avaricious and encroaching rail<br />
Seized the wide fields which knew the Indian's trail.<br />
Back to the reservations in the West<br />
The native owners of the land were pressed,<br />
And selfish cities, harbingers of want,<br />
Shut from their vision each accustomed haunt.<br />
Yet hungry Progress, never satisfied,<br />
Gazed on the western plains, and gazing, longed and sighed.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>As some strange bullock in a pasture field<br />
Compels the herds to fear him, and to yield<br />
The juicy grass plots and the cooling shade<br />
Until, despite their greater strength, afraid,<br />
They huddle in some corner spot and cower<br />
Before the monarch's all controlling power,<br />
So has the white man driven from its place<br />
By his aggressive greed, Columbia's native race.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Yet when the bull pursues the herds at bay,<br />
Incensed they turn, and dare dispute his sway.<br />
And so the Indians turned, when men forgot<br />
Their sacred word, and trespassed on the spot.<br />
The lonely little spot of all their lands,<br />
The reservation of the peaceful bands.<br />
But lust for gold all conscience kills in man,<br />
"Gold in the Black Hills, gold!" the cry arose and ran</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>From lip to lip, as flames from tree to tree<br />
Leap till the forest is one fiery sea,<br />
And through the country surged that hot unrest<br />
Which thirst for riches wakens in the breast.<br />
In mighty throngs the fortune hunters came,<br />
Despoiled the red man's lands and slew his game,<br />
Broke solemn treaties and defied the law.<br />
And all these ruthless acts the Nation knew and saw.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Man is the only animal that kills<br />
Just for the wanton love of slaughter; spills<br />
The blood of lesser things to see it flow;<br />
Lures like a friend, to murder like a foe<br />
The trusting bird and beast; and, coward like,<br />
Deals covert blows he dare not boldly strike.<br />
The brutes have finer souls, and only slay<br />
When torn by hunger's pangs, or when to fear a prey.</p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>The pale-faced hunter, insolent and bold,<br />
Pursued the bison while he sought for gold.<br />
And on the hungry red man's own domains<br />
He left the rotting and unused remains<br />
To foul with sickening stench each passing wind<br />
And rouse the demon in the savage mind,<br />
Save in the heart where virtues dominate<br />
Injustice always breeds its natural offspring&mdash;hate.</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>The chieftain of the Sioux, great Sitting Bull,<br />
Mused o'er their wrongs, and felt his heart swell full<br />
Of bitter vengeance. Torn with hate's unrest<br />
He called a council and his braves addressed.<br />
"From fair Wisconsin's shimmering lakes of blue<br />
Long years ago the white man drove the Sioux.<br />
Made bold by conquest, and inflamed by greed,<br />
He still pursues our tribes, and still our ranks recede.</p>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p>"Fair are the White Chief's promises and words,<br />
But dark his deeds who robs us of our herds.<br />
He talks of treaties, asks the right to buy,<br />
Then takes by force, not waiting our reply.<br />
He grants us lands for pastures and abodes<br />
To devastate them by his iron roads.<br />
But now from happy Spirit Lands, a friend<br />
Draws near the hunted Sioux, to strengthen and defend.</p>


<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>"While walking in the fields I saw a star;<br />
Unconsciously I followed it afar&mdash;<br />
It led me on to valleys filled with light,<br />
Where danced our noble chieftains slain in fight.<br />
Black Kettle, first of all that host I knew,<br />
He whom the strong armed Custer foully slew.<br />
And then a spirit took me by the hand,<br />
The Great Messiah King who comes to free the land.</p>


<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>"Suns were his eyes, a speaking tear his voice,<br />
Whose rainbow sounds made listening hearts rejoice<br />
And thus he spake: 'The red man's hour draws near<br />
When all his lost domains shall reappear.<br />
The elk, the deer, the bounding antelope,<br />
Shall here return to grace each grassy slope.'<br />
He waved his hand above the fields, and lo!<br />
Down through the valleys came a herd of buffalo.</p>


<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>"The wondrous vision vanished, but I knew<br />
That Sitting Bull must make the promise true.<br />
Great Spirits plan what mortal man achieves,<br />
The hand works magic when the heart believes.<br />
Arouse, ye braves! let not the foe advance.<br />
Arm for the battle and begin the dance&mdash;<br />
The sacred dance in honor of our slain,<br />
Who will return to earth, ere many moons shall wane."</p>


<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p>Thus Sitting Bull, the chief of wily knaves,<br />
Worked on the superstitions of his braves.<br />
Mixed truth with lies; and stirred to mad unrest<br />
The warlike instinct in each savage breast.<br />
A curious product of unhappy times,<br />
The natural offspring of unnumbered crimes,<br />
He used low cunning and dramatic arts<br />
To startle and surprise those crude untutored hearts.</p>


<h3>XV.</h3>

<p>Out from the lodges pour a motley throng,<br />
Slow measures chanting of a dirge-like song.<br />
In one great circle dizzily they swing,<br />
A squaw and chief alternate in the ring.<br />
Coarse raven locks stream over robes of white,<br />
Their deep set orbs emit a lurid light,<br />
And as through pine trees moan the winds refrains,<br />
So swells and dies away, the ghostly graveyard strains.</p>


<h3>XVI.</h3>

<p>Like worded wine is music to the ear,<br />
And long-indulged makes mad the hearts that hear.<br />
The dancers, drunken with the monotone<br />
Of oft repeated notes, now shriek and groan<br />
And pierce their ruddy flesh with sharpened spears;<br />
Still more excited when the blood appears,<br />
With warlike yells, high in the air they bound,<br />
Then in a deathlike trance fall prostrate on the ground.</p>


<h3>XVII.</h3>

<p>They wake to tell weird stories of the dead,<br />
While fresh performers to the ring are led.<br />
The sacred nature of the dance is lost,<br />
War is their cry, red war, at any cost.<br />
Insane for blood they wait for no command,<br />
But plunge marauding through the frightened land.<br />
Their demon hearts on devils' pleasures bent,<br />
For each new foe surprised, new torturing deaths invent.</p>


<h3>XVIII.</h3>

<p>Staked to the earth one helpless creature lies,<br />
Flames at his feet and splinters in his eyes.<br />
Another groans with coals upon his breast,<br />
While 'round the pyre the Indians dance and jest.<br />
A crying child is brained upon a tree,<br />
The swooning mother saved from death, to be<br />
The slave and plaything of a filthy knave,<br />
Whose sins would startle hell, whose clay defile a grave.</p>


<h3>XIX.</h3>

<p>Their cause was right, their methods all were wrong.<br />
Pity and censure both to them belong.<br />
Their woes were many, but their crimes were more.<br />
The soulless Satan holds not in his store<br />
Such awful tortures as the Indians' wrath<br />
Keeps for the hapless victim in his path.<br />
And if the last lone remnants of that race<br />
Were by the white man swept from off the earth's fair face,</p>


<h3>XX.</h3>

<p>Were every red man slaughtered in a day,<br />
Still would that sacrifice but poorly pay<br />
For one insulted woman captive's woes.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%; Margin-left: 1em; Margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;" />

<p>Again great Custer in his strength arose,<br />
More daring, more intrepid than of old.<br />
The passing years had touched and turned to gold<br />
The ever widening aureole of fame<br />
That shone upon his brow, and glorified his name.</p>


<h3>XXI.</h3>

<p>Wise men make laws, then turn their eyes away,<br />
While fools and knaves ignore them day by day;<br />
And unmolested, fools and knaves at length<br />
Induce long wars which sap a country's strength.<br />
The sloth of leaders, ruling but in name,<br />
Has dragged full many a nation down to shame.<br />
A word unspoken by the rightful lips<br />
Has dyed the land with blood, and blocked the sea with ships.</p>


<h3>XXII.</h3>

<p>The word withheld, when Indians asked for aid,<br />
Came when the red man started on his raid.<br />
What Justice with a gesture might have done<br />
Was left for noisy war with bellowing gun.<br />
And who save Custer and his gallant men<br />
Could calm the tempest into peace again?<br />
What other hero in the land could hope<br />
With Sitting Bull, the fierce and lawless one to cope?</p>


<h3>XXIII.</h3>

<p>What other warrior skilled enough to dare<br />
Surprise that human tiger in his lair?<br />
Sure of his strength, unconscious of his fame<br />
Out from the quiet of the camp he came;<br />
And stately as Diana at his side<br />
Elizabeth, his wife and alway bride,<br />
And Margaret, his sister, rode apace;<br />
Love's clinging arms he left to meet death's cold embrace.</p>


<h3>XXIV.</h3>

<p>As the bright column wound along its course,<br />
The smiling leader turned upon his horse<br />
To gaze with pride on that superb command.<br />
Twelve hundred men, the picked of all the land,<br />
Innured to hardship and made strong by strife<br />
Their lithe limbed bodies breathed of out-door life;<br />
While on their faces, resolute and brave,<br />
Hope stamped its shining seal, although their thoughts were grave.</p>


<h3>XXV.</h3>

<p>The sad eyed women halted in the dawn,<br />
And waved farewell to dear ones riding on.<br />
The modest mist picked up her robes and ran<br />
Before the Sun god's swift pursuing van.<br />
And suddenly there burst on startled eyes,<br />
The sight of soldiers, marching in the skies;<br />
That phantom host, a phantom Custer led;<br />
Mirage of dire portent, forecasting days ahead.</p>


<h3>XXVI.</h3>

<p>The soldier's children, flaunting mimic flags,<br />
Played by the roadside, striding sticks for nags.<br />
Their mothers wept, indifferent to the crowd<br />
Who saw their tears and heard them sob aloud.<br />
Old Indian men and squaws crooned forth a rhyme<br />
Sung by their tribes from immemorial time;<br />
And over all the drums' incessant beat<br />
Mixed with the scout's weird rune, and tramp of myriad feet.</p>


<h3>XXVII.</h3>

<p>So flawless was the union of each part<br />
The mighty column (moved as by one heart)<br />
Pulsed through the air, like some sad song well sung,<br />
Which gives delight, although the soul is wrung.<br />
Farther and fainter to the sight and sound<br />
The beautiful embodied poem wound;<br />
Till like a ribbon, stretched across the land<br />
Seemed the long narrow line of that receding band.</p>


<h3>XXVIII.</h3>

<p>The lot of those who in the silence wait<br />
Is harder than the fighting soldiers' fate.<br />
Back to the lonely post two women passed,<br />
With unaccustomed sorrow overcast.<br />
Two sad for sighs, too desolate for tears,<br />
The dark forebodings of long widowed years<br />
In preparation for the awful blow<br />
Hung on the door of hope the sable badge of woe.</p>


<h3>XXIX.</h3>

<p>Unhappy Muse! for thee no song remains,<br />
Save the sad mis&eacute;r&eacute;r&eacute; of the plains.<br />
Yet though defeat, not triumph, ends the tale,<br />
Great victors sometimes are the souls that fail.<br />
All glory lies not in the goals we reach,<br />
But in the lessons which our actions teach.<br />
And he who, conquered, to the end believes<br />
In God and in himself, though vanquished, still achieves.</p>


<h3>XXX.</h3>

<p>Ah, grand as rash was that last fatal raid<br />
The little group of daring heroes made.<br />
Two hundred and two score intrepid men<br />
Rode out to war; not one came back again.<br />
Like fiends incarnate from the depths of hell<br />
Five thousand foemen rose with deafening yell,<br />
And swept that vale as with a simoon's breath,<br />
But like the gods of old, each martyr met his death.</p>


<h3>XXXI.</h3>

<p>Like gods they battled and like gods they died.<br />
Hour following hour that little band defied<br />
The hordes of red men swarming o'er the plain,<br />
Till scarce a score stood upright 'mid the slain.<br />
Then in the lull of battle, creeping near,<br />
A scout breathed low in Custer's listening ear:<br />
"<i>Death lies before, dear life remains behind</i><br />
<i>Mount thy sure-footed steed, and hasten with the wind</i>."</p>


<h3>XXXII.</h3>

<p>A second's silence. Custer dropped his head,<br />
His lips slow moving as when prayers are said&mdash;<br />
Two words he breathed&mdash;"God and Elizabeth,"<br />
Then shook his long locks in the face of death,<br />
And with a final gesture turned away<br />
To join that fated few who stood at bay.<br />
Ah! deeds like that the Christ in man reveal<br />
Let Fame descend her throne at Custer's shrine to kneel.</p>


<h3>XXXIII.</h3>

<p>Too late to rescue, but in time to weep,<br />
His tardy comrades came. As if asleep<br />
He lay, so fair, that even hellish hate<br />
Withheld its hand and dared not mutilate.<br />
By fiends who knew not honor, honored still,<br />
He smiled and slept on that far western hill.<br />
Cast down thy lyre, oh Muse! thy song is done!<br />
Let tears complete the tale of him who failed, yet won.</p>
